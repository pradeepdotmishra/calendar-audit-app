# Calendar Audit Tool

<h3>Summary</h3></br>
The goal of this tool is to enable users to perform “Calendar Audit”.
The purpose of this audit is to help users to track how much time they are spending on
meetings, and if they are conducting the right meetings and spending their time on the right
goals.
This tool will look at a user's calendar and generate a report detailing the time spent by the user.</br>
<h3>Requirements</h3></br>
This tool will work with Google Calendar. It should read the user’s primary calendar and
generate a report which can be printed to console or displayed on an HTML page or API based.
Focus on how to get the calendar updates as soon as possible, so the user should feel it as
instantaneous after making a change in his/her calendar.
Following are some of the metrics that can be shown. You should print at least three of the
following metrics. You can consider any additional metrics beyond these as well if time permits.</br>
1. Total time spent in meetings per month for the last 3 months </br>
2. Which month had the highest number of meetings / least number of meetings</br>
3. Busiest week / relaxed week - you can select a threshold of your choice</br>
4. Average number of meetings per week, average time spent every week in
meetings.</br>
5. Top 3 persons with whom you have meetings</br>
6. Time spent in Recruiting/Conducting interview
